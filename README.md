# HOI4 - Back in the USSA
An alternative history mod for Hearts of Iron IV

"Back in the USSA" is an alternative history mod that is based off of the idea proposed by the 1997 collection of short stories with the same name. This idea is an AU in which the United States has a communist revolution while Russia does not. The finalized mod would modify the focus trees, decisions, etc. to reflect such a world during the time period of HOI4.

# Background
The current Historical Narrative document details the currently accepted lore of this mod. This is a living, breathing document that is quite regularly changed as all of our contributors work to create a historically plausible world.
